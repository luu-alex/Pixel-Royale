Server-side:

->We use tokens to check if user is logged in or not and authentication

->our site is a single page application

->we use the rest api, using the POST,GET,UPDATE and DELETE http requests

-> we error check user login information

-> if they have a valid token they go to the index page instead of starting at the login page

-> stats page to record information and users can pull there own information as well as the scoreboard

Front-end:

-> Player doesn't start with a gun but the player is able to grab guns off the ground and use them or drop and grab another one.


-> Keyboard movements are WASD and E allows the player to grab a weapon, and Q enables dropping the gun. R turns on the build mode, where similar to Fortnite, player can create walls and set them anywhere they like. The Mouse also points the gun, left click shoots normally and builds in build mode. The right click changes the formation of the block in build mode.


-> When ammunition runs out, the player has to ability to pick up more around the map, and each gun takes the right amount of bullets for their respective magazines. The player can also view relative information about the guns they are holding, the amount of ammo, and health level all in the game.

-> Game has music, animation, and different sprites



-> Bullets can be seen leaving the guns and they can kill bots and bots can kill players using the same techniques, bullets also make sound.


-> There is a GUI that displays ammo and hp and a  mini-map.  The world shrinks and players/bots will lose hp if they are outside of the circle


-> There are tele-porters on the left side of the map and the right side of the map, pressing e will transport you to the other side.


-> World is large and is randomly generated every time. from the placement of the trees, the grass lands and desert lands, ammunition placements and gun placements to the difference in players speed running on different terrain. Trees can be shot down so can walls made by players, since these objects have health meters.

-> Two types of AI where each are known as dumb bot and smart bot where the dumb bots run around in chaos while staying in the safe zone and they can hit and kill player. Smart bot can actively grab a gun and chase players and try to kill them, and if their gun runs out of ammo, they make the decision to either grab ammo or drop their gun to get a new gun (whichever is closest). Dumb bots run really fast and are rash but smart bots are slow and calculated.

-> Player spwans in the middle of the map but all bots are randomly generated to spwan at different places.

-> Different types of guns, from the shotgun that shoots three bullets at the same time, to the flame thrower that throws 5 bullet elements at the same time. Bazooka and 9mm simply hit 1 bullet at the same time. That being said the range of the sniper is longer then the rest whereas the range of the flame thrower and bazooka is shorter and the speeds of the bullets are slower.

-> movements of all players smoothed out to make the gaming experience better and to feel less buggy. Similar to fortnite play rea shrinks so that the intensity of the game can increase. (Mini map clearly shows that)
